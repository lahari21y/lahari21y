            SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data within database tables. SQL's powerful querying capabilities enable the retrieval of specific data through SELECT statements, while other commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE manage data modifications. SQL also supports database schema creation and modification with CREATE, ALTER, and DROP commands.
